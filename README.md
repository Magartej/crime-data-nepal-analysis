# Overview

This repository contains machine learning code for analyzing crime data in Nepal using **Google Colab**. The dataset used originates from crime-related statistics and aims to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within Nepal's crime landscape.

The analysis includes a wide variety of machine learning and statistical methods to understand the nature of crime, its distribution, and possible influencing factors. The data is preprocessed, analyzed, visualized, and modeled to extract insights and make predictive assessments.

## Introduction to Crime Analysis in Nepal

Crime analysis involves the systematic study of crime patterns and trends to help law enforcement and the public understand safety issues and inform policy decisions. In the context of Nepal, understanding crime statistics is crucial for formulating preventive strategies, improving law enforcement tactics, and increasing public awareness.

Key crimes analyzed may include theft, assault, domestic violence, cybercrime, and more, depending on the dataset. Proper analysis helps identify hotspots, repeat offenses, and correlations with demographic or socioeconomic variables.
