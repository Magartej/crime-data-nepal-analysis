## Introduction to Crime Analysis in Nepal

Crime analysis involves the systematic study of crime patterns and trends to help law enforcement and the public understand safety issues and inform policy decisions. In the context of Nepal, understanding crime statistics is crucial for formulating preventive strategies, improving law enforcement tactics, and increasing public awareness.

Key crimes analyzed may include theft, assault, domestic violence, cybercrime, and more, depending on the dataset. Proper analysis helps identify hotspots, repeat offenses, and correlations with demographic or socioeconomic variables.
